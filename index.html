                    <p>Hello! I am Griffin Doyle and I am a Sydney based Software Developer!<p>
                    <p>
                        I am in the process of finalising my Bachelors of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Science degrees while looking
                        for an entryway into a software development career path.
                    </p>
                    <p> Throughout my studies I have had extensive experience working with Python, as well as working with a number of
                        technologies including databases (PostgreSQL), AWS (Lambda, EC2), Big Data (Hadoop, Spark), Functional Programming
                        (Haskell), Object-Oriented Programming (Java) and Network Programming.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>The University of New South Wales: 2020 - 2024</p>
            <p>Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Software</p>
            <p>Bachelor of Science in Physics</p>
            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p><b>Aurecon Project (Feb 2024 - April 2024):</b> As a project team member, I headed the research efforts to produce a recommendation report to
                alleviate an increasingly unstable grid with the introduction of new renewable power sources. Our solution included a
                myriad of technical and policy recommendations, including community batteries, innovative smart inverter technology at
                premises and government subsidy initiatives. This work was done in tandem with industry experts from both Aurecon and
                Transgrid who were presented with our insights throughout the research process.
            </p>
            <p><b>Coles Duty Manager (November 2019 - Present):</b>
            Throughout my studies, I have worked as a Coles Duty Manager where I am tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the
            grocery store outside of daytime hours. I was promoted to this position as a recognition of my dedication to the company
            and hard work. My role as a duty manager includes liasing with external contractors, time management, employee
            coordination and conflict resolution.
            <p>
            <h3>Outside of Dev</h3>
            Outside of working on my projects, I have some other interests such as video games, cooking and bouldering.
